   Argus background shape
      For :code:`RooFit` object, see `RooArgusBG <https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classRooArgusBG.html>`_.

   BEPC
      Beijing Electron-Positron Collider. Currently the second 'version': **BEPCII**.

   BESIII
      Beijing Electron Spectrometer III

   BOSS
      BESIII Offline Software System

   Breit-Wigner parametrization

      * Analytical continuation of the Breit-Wigner parametrization
      * Does not allow for extraction of pole parameters, only ratios

      * Only works in case of *narrow structure* and if there are no other resonances nearby
      * Can be used to extract *pole parameters* such as particle width
      * Possible: energy dependent parameters

   CAS

   Chebychev polynomial
      For RooFit object, see ​ `RooChebychev <https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classRooChebychev.html>`_.

   Dalitz plot
      Used in case of three-body decays. |br|
      See `PDG on Kinematics <http://pdg.lbl.gov/2018/reviews/rpp2018-rev-kinematics.pdf>`_, section 47.4.3.1.

   Efficiency

   Exclusive Monte Carlo simulation
      You only generate events with decays that are of interest to your analysis.

   Flatté parametrization

      * Analytical continuation of the Breit-Wigner parametrization
      * Does not allow for extraction of pole parameters, only ratios

   IHEP
      `Institute of High Energy Physics <http://english.ihep.cas.cn/>`_, part of the :term:`CAS`

   Inclusive Monte Carlo simulation
      You generate event as completely as possible. Since this takes a lot of computing resources, one usually makes use of the data sets that were reconstructed by the BOSS team for your version of BOSS. For the file locations of inclusive :math:`J/\psi` samples, see `this page <https://docbes3.ihep.ac.cn/~offlinesoftware/index.php/Jpsi_data>`_ [requires login].

   Semantic versioning
      See `here <https://semver.org/>`__. This is essentially a numbering scheme used for tagging versions of a package. Within BOSS, a package can for instance be given tag :code:`Package-01-04-03` , where :code:`01` is the major ID, :code:`04` the minor ID, and :code:`03` the patch ID.
