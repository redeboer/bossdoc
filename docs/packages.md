# Introduction

The aim of this part of the BOSS GitBook is to provide accessible instructions
for usage of certain package as well as to provide a platform where
documentation on all packages is collected. A vast amount of tools is already
available, but an overview of these package does not yet exist, let alone an
overview that can be continuously contributed to and updated by any BESIII
member interested.

Following the Software Guide of the
[BESIII Offline Software Group](https://docbes3.ihep.ac.cn/~offlinesoftware/index.php/Main_Page)
(login required), the packages are categorized in the following four
categories:

1. {doc}`Generation <packages/generation>`
2. {doc}`Simulation <packages/simulation>`
3. {doc}`Reconstruction <packages/reconstruction>`
4. {doc}`Analysis <packages/analysis>`

{doc}`Contributions </contribute>` to these pages are vital, as there are
continuous improvements to the BOSS analysis framework.
