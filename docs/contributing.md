# About & Contributing

The BOSS GitBook has been set up not only to provide a set of **accessible**
tutorial pages on the use of BOSS, but also a continuously updated **inventory
of the available packages**. For now, it serves as a central, informal location
to collect information about BESIII, but the aim is to migrate its content to a
formal, interactive BESIII platform as soon as that has been set up.

**It is quite easy to contribute!** There are a two ways to do this:

- **Through GitBook** Using the GitBook web interface is the most convenient
  method to collaborate on these tutorial pages: you can comment, discuss, work
  with drafts, merge them, etc. You can get login details by emailing
  [remco.de.boer@ihep.ac.cn](mailto:remco.de.boer@ihep.ac.cn).

- **Through GitHub** Otherwise, you can always fork the underlying repository
  ([github.com/redeboer/BOSS_GitBook](https://github.com/redeboer/BOSS_GitBook))
  and add suggestions by
  [submitting a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).

## Contributing through Git

For this, you will have to [create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join)
(you will be redirected if you already have one). I can then add your account
as a contributor. A [branch](https://help.github.com/articles/about-branches)
will then be created for you in which you can change anything you want. If you
would like to publish your changes to the main branch so that they become
accessible for all.

See [here](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow) for a short tutorial
about the Git workflow.
