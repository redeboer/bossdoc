Beyond BOSS
===========

BEAN
----

BEAN is a ROOT-based analysis framework designed for the BES3 experiment.
**BEAN** stands for the **BE** S3 **AN** alysis. The goal is to develop a
lightweight analysis software, more simple and easy to use than BOSS. It is not
a replacement of BOSS simulation and reconstruction software. Currently BEAN
supports KinematicFit , ParticleID, MagneticField, EventTag and AbsCor analysis
tools ported from BOSS. BEAN is capable for the parallel computing, and
supports PROOF in very transparent way.
