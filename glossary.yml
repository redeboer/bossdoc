BEPC: |
  Beijing Electron-Positron Collider. Currently the second 'version': **BEPCII**.

BESIII: |
  Beijing Electron Spectrometer III

BOSS: |
  BESIII Offline Software System

Breit-Wigner parametrization: |
  * Analytical continuation of the Breit-Wigner parametrization
  * Does not allow for extraction of pole parameters, only ratios
  * Only works in case of *narrow structure* and if there are no other resonances nearby
  * Can be used to extract *pole parameters* such as particle width
  * Possible: energy dependent parameters

Dalitz plot: |
  Used in case of three-body decays. <br>

Exclusive Monte Carlo simulation: |
  You only generate events with decays that are of interest to your analysis.

Flatt√© parametrization: |
  * Analytical continuation of the Breit-Wigner parametrization
  * Does not allow for extraction of pole parameters, only ratios

IHEP: |

Inclusive Monte Carlo simulation: |
  You generate event as completely as possible. Since this takes a lot of computing resources, one usually makes use of the data sets that were reconstructed by the BOSS team for your version of BOSS. For the file locations of inclusive $J/\psi$ samples, see [this page](https://docbes3.ihep.ac.cn/~offlinesoftware/index.php/Jpsi_data) [requires login].

Semantic versioning: |
  See [here](https://semver.org). This is essentially a numbering scheme used for tagging versions of a package. Within BOSS, a package can for instance be given tag `Package-01-04-03`, where `01` is the major ID, `04` the minor ID, and `03` the patch ID.
