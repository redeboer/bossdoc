This part of the tutorial focuses on setting up your BOSS environment on the IHEP server. It is essential to follow these steps if you haven't already done so, but you can also just browse through these steps to see if you missed anything. These tutorial pages also aim at providing more context about what you are actually doing, so they can also be useful if you are not a beginner.
